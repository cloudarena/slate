# Introduction

Welcome to the HotelRunner APPS API! You can use our APPS API to access HotelRunner APPS API endpoints, which can get information on rooms, reservations and even make price & availability updates.

We have language bindings in Shell and Ruby! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
<b><code>token</code></b> and <b><code>hr_id</code></b> parameters must be sent for authentication.
