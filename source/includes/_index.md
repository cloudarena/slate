# Introduction [Property]

Welcome to the HotelRunner Apps API! You can use our Apps API to access HotelRunner's api endpoints,
which can get information on rooms, reservations, make price & availability updates and even receive real-time reservation updates.

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right.

# Authentication [Property]

HotelRunner uses TOKEN and HR_ID keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new HotelRunner Apps API key at your property panel under My Property section.

<aside class="notice">
<b><code>token</code></b> and <b><code>hr_id</code></b> parameters must be sent for authentication.
